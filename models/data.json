In the first domain for moderately\nlarge fractions, immediate detection is possible. In the second domain for\nsmaller fractions, the detection delay grows logarithmically with the number of\ndetectors, with an asymptotic constant extending those in sparse normal mixture\ndetection. In the third domain for even smaller fractions, the detection delay\nlies in the framework of the classical detection delay formula of Lorden. We\nshow that the optimal detection delay is achieved by the sum of detectability\nscore transformations of either the partial scores or CUSUM scores of the data\nstreams.",

	"summary": "Face detection is one of the challenging tasks in computer vision. Human face\ndetection plays an essential role in the first stage of face processing\napplications such as face recognition, face tracking, image database\nmanagement, etc. In these applications, face objects often come from an\ninconsequential part of images that contain variations, namely different\nillumination, poses, and occlusion. These variations can decrease face\ndetection rate noticeably. Most existing face detection approaches are not\naccurate, as they have not been able to resolve unstructured images due to\nlarge appearance variations and can only detect human faces under one\nparticular variation. Existing frameworks of face detection need enhancements\nto detect human faces under the stated variations to improve detection rate and\nreduce detection time. In this study, an enhanced face detection framework is\nproposed to improve detection rate based on skin color and provide a validation\nprocess. A preliminary segmentation of the input images based on skin color can\nsignificantly reduce search space and accelerate the process of human face\ndetection. The primary detection is based on Haar-like features and the\nAdaboost algorithm. A validation process is introduced to reject non-face\nobjects, which might occur during the face detection process. The validation\nprocess is based on two-stage Extended Local Binary Patterns. The experimental\nresults on the CMU-MIT and Caltech 10000 datasets over a wide range of facial\nvariations in different colors, positions, scales, and lighting conditions\nindicated a successful face detection rate.",
